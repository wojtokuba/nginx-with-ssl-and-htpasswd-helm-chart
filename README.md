## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add my-repo https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install my-release my-repo/nginx
```

## Introduction

Bitnami charts for Helm are carefully engineered, actively maintained and are the quickest and easiest way to deploy containers on a Kubernetes cluster that are ready to handle production workloads.

This chart bootstraps a [NGINX Open Source](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/nginx) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm repo add my-repo https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install my-release my-repo/nginx
```

These commands deploy NGINX Open Source on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
